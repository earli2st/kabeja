# Kabeja

### How to build in Netbeans

* open project in Netbeans
* do a clean and build 

### How to make a build in IntelliJ IDEA

* Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
* Right-click `pom.xml` and select **Add as Maven Project**
* Right-click `pom.xml` and select **Maven** > **Reimport**
* Open **View** > **Tool Windows** > **Maven Projects**
* Activate **Profiles** > **blocks**, in the popup choose **Enable Auto-Import**
* Go to **File** > **Project Structure**
    * Under **Project** set your SDK
    * Under **Artifacts** select **+** > **JAR** > **From modules with dependencies...**
    * Select your desired module, e.g. **tfly-kabeja-dxf** and press **Ok**, **Ok**
* Now you can build your **jar** by choosing **Build** > **Build Artifacts...** > **tfly-kabeja-dxf:jar** > **Build** 
    
    * Your **jar** is now at `out` or `classes` > `/artifacts/tfly_kabeja_dxf_jar/tfly-kabeja-dxf.jar`

### How to debug
* As the initial kabeja project is discontinued, there arise issues with new DXF-versions from time to time
* The class `org.kabeja.dxf.Main` can be used to test new implementations and bugfixes
* Inserts `org.kabeja.entities.Insert` and the method `toWcs()` in `org.kabeja.entities.Entity` frequently turned out to be the root of the problem
* For further information see the most current [DXF specification](https://documentation.help/AutoCAD-DXF/). For issues regarding rotated entities, check out the sections about the *Object Coordinate Systems (OCS)* and the *Arbitrary Axis Algorithm*

### Library for parsing DXF files and conversion to SVG

It is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0.

Current state: The original Kabeja project has not been updated since 2010. Third parties have since worked on the library. Most importantly the build system was changed from Ant to Maven. Unfortunately this left parts of the program in a partially broken state. The library part itself works but the _GUI and the CLI are currently broken_.

**The *accu:rate* fork adds limited XData support.**

## Limitations
Not all DXF entities are supported yet. Text entities are still problematic.

## Supported entities
* Arc
* Attrib
* Polyline
* Circle
* Line
* Blocks/Insert
* Text
* MText
* LWPolyline
* Solid
* Trace
* Ellipse
* Dimension
* Image
* Leader
* XLine
* Ray
* Hatch
* Spline
* MLine
* **In this fork: XData (limited support)**  (extracting XData, generate XData (including APPID table))


## CLI
***launcher.jar is currently not built by the Maven script.***

In the Kabeja-folder try:
* Help and pipeline list:

  `java -jar launcher.jar --help`

* Convert to svg

  `java -jar launcher.jar -nogui -pipeline svg myfile.dxf result.svg`

* Convert to pdf|jpeg|png|...

  `java -jar launcher.jar -nogui -pipeline <pdf|jpeg|png>  myfile.dxf`

If you experience OOM problems, try `java -Xmx256m`

## GUI
The GUI is currently broken.

## Cocoon
[Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/) is an XML Publishing Framework.

Copy `kabeja.jar` and `kabeja-svg2dxf-cocoon.jar` to your `WEB-INF/lib` folder
of your Cocoon web application. Then you can use Kabeja as Generator like:

In your `sitemap/subsitemap`:

```
<map:components>
    .....   
    <map:generators default="file">
        <map:generator name="dxf2svg" src="org.kabeja.cocoon.generation.DXF2SVGGenerator"/>
    </map:generators>

....
<map:pipelines>
    <map:pipeline>
        <map:match pattern="dxf/*.svg">
            <map:generate type="dxf2svg" src="dxf/{1}.dxf"/>
            ...
            <!-- transform things you need -->
            <map:serialize type="xml"/>
        </map:match>
    </map:pipeline>
    ....
</map:pipelines>
```

Note: Large DXF drafts will cause SVGDocument to consume a lot of memory. The Generator is
Cacheable so the first run will take more time.
